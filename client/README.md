# RedDrop Frontend

Frontend for RedDrop.

## Run

Please, run this project with pnpm as we don't want some crazy *.lock.json file sitting around the repo.  If you don't have pnpm installed, then install it via: `npm i -g pnpm`. And this project uses npm in case you haven't figured out. Install that too if you don't have it.
`pnpm i`
`pnpm run dev`
